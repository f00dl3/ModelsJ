# ModelsJ

PREVIEW - Not all functionally fully working yet!

SQL table design not included. You will need to create mappings in SQL to help this along based on what/how much data you want.
A fast Internet connection is required. And unlimited data. 3-4 TB (3000-4000 GB)/month data use to be expected.
