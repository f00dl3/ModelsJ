Java Model Data Processor

PREVIEW - Not all functionally fully working yet!

SQL table design not included. You will need to create mappings in SQL to help this along based on what/how much data you want.
A fast Internet connection is required. And unlimited data.
Be warned. This script is easily capable of processing 3-5 TB/month of data. 
Without the 2 High-resolution western US computer models, it already eats 2-3 TB/month.
